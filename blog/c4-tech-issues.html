      One of the problems existing in technology world right now, is bringing wireless services to rural areas.
    </p>
    <p>
      While a lot of people , living in cities or suburbs , take Internet service for granted, it is quite different in some areas.
    </p>
    <p>
      People living in remote areas need connection not only in schools and libraries, but at their homes as well, and not for entertainment only. And still there are many places without Internet , mostly because residences are too far from each other , so signal is not strong enough to reach everyone. And even when it's possible to provide Internet there, it is not profitable for the companies to invest in such areas with so less customers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, now there solutions to this issue
    </p>
    <p>
      WI-Fi, economically, makes easier to provide Internet-there is no need for long wires to be extended for  long distances. But it comes with such issue as security.
    </p>
    <p>
      Satellites are great option, they can cover much bigger areas than base wi-fi stations. But Internet signal provided with satellite services depends on weather, so is not very reliable. Besides, with satellites being in space there is a problem of serving and replacing equipment, that can be very costly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another Internet providing solution is using balloons. The balloons have all equipment with them, they are filled with hydrogen, floating kilometers above Earth's surface . Once they pop, the equipment drifts to the ground carried by parashute. The balloons are refilled, and released again. So in this case it is way easier to fix broken equipment . And the areas covered with this method are still much bigger than areas covered by base stations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being the most recent idea for problem of providing Internet services to the rural areas, so far balloons seem like very promising solution.
