      PAIRING SESSIONS
    </p>
    <p>
      To be honest, I was kind of sceptical about pairing sessions entering Phase 0. Most of my school or college time I found myself enjoying solving problems on my own, so that I can take full credit for my accomplishments, and also I felt that if I work with someone who does not understand the subject enough,I have to slow down; and when working with someone who is good with the topic, it often get more to competing than cooperaring.
    </p>
    <p>
       But I found it different here. The difference probably is because in programming there are so many different ways to complete same problem, so I find myself being able both to benefit to pairing session by learning something new, and contribute to it. Most of the times I feel eally impressed with how much I learn from person I work with. And I find that I finish problems way faster while pairing, because there is a timeboxing there, and I still work on being able to timebox myself through studying.
    </p>
    <p>
       So that's on the fun part.
    </p>
    <p>
      Difficult part for me is to be able to admit when I am struggling and ask questions, so that i really learn instead of just follow my pair's insructions. That is what I try to work on.

      FEEDBACK EXPERIENCE
    </p>
    <p>
      I admit that feedback is not my favourite thing . If session goes well, it is hard to write anything actionable, and most sessions went geat for me.
    </p>
    <p>
       I think that might be the reason why I don't receive much actionable feedback either. As for kind part, of course I like receiving complements on how good I am, and if it's its specific , makes me feel even better.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did receive few actionable feedbacks, which I really appreciate. It points out some flaws I did not want to admit, or did not see at all.
      I do not have problems on receiving feedback, even more, I need to learn to rejec it sometimes , if it is not sincere, or not benefitting for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, I find pairing sessions really contributing to my studying process, and I would definitely not be where I am right now with coding without them.
