    <p>
    Knowledge about Regular Expressions come in handy when working with string on advanced level. Regular Expression (regexp) is a search query, and it is formatted as a string that describes a pattern for matching elements in other strings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regular Expression is used with string-formatting methods, lile:
      <pre>
        string = "I am a simple string"
        puts string.sub(/..$/,'blah')
        =>'I am a simple striblah'
      </pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      Here /..$/ is a regex, where '.' stands for character, and '$' - for the end of the line. Similarly, /^../ means 'first 2 characters in the line'
    </p>
    <p>
      So, as previous examples show, we use regexp to find certain patterns in strings ( to delete those patterns, replace them,print them out, store somewhere, etc.)
    </p>
    <p>
      We can also iterate through a string, like:
      <pre>
        string.scan(/./) {|letter| puts letter}
      </pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      We can also scan for any amount of characters:
    </p>
    <p>
      'string.scan(/.../)' - scans for 3 characters;
    </p>
    <p>
      'string.scan(/\w\w/)'-scans for any two
      letters/digits/underscore characters in a row
    </p>
    <p>
      for regexp, there are special characters that are denoted with '\', each of them has special meaning:
   <pre>
      ^ - anchor for the beginning of a line

      $ - anchor for the end of a line

      \A - anchor for the start of a string

      \Z - anchor for the end of the string

      . - any character

      \w - any letter/digit/underscore

      \W - anything that '\w' does not match

      \d - any digit

      \D - any non-digit

      \s - whitespace (including tabs, newline, etc.)

      \S - non-whitespace
    </pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's say, we want to iterate through words/numbers in a string, and of course words in a string will have different length. For this purpose, we should use '+' , that follows '\w' or '\d' character. '+' matches as many characters in a row of the same type as it finds:
    <pre>
      "this is a test".scan(/\w+/) { |word| p word}
      => this
         is
         a
         test
    </pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    Other useful modifiers are:
  </p>
  <p>
    {x} - matches x occurences of preceding character
  </p>
  <p>
    {x,y} - matches at leat x, at most y characters
  </p>
  <p>
    Character class-  explicit list of all characters put inside the regexp in []. For example, to scan through all vowels:
    <pre>
      string.scan(/[aeiou]/) {|x| p x}
    </pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    To scan through range of characters:
    <pre>
      string.scan(/[a-f]/) {|x| p x}
    </pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    To check whether string matches the pattern:
    <pre>
      string =~/[pattern]/
    </pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    '~' is called 'matching operator' . It returns the position of the first match ( or nil, if match is not found).
  </p>
  <p>
    To look for all but certain characters, we can negate character class. For example, to look for all characters except vowels:
    <pre>
      string =~/[^aeiou]/
    </pre>
  </p>
