  <h1>Asking questions. Perfect question.</h1>

       Today I have asked my husband on what he thinks about my website.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at it, and said,-"It looks nice, I like the colors."
    </p>
    <p>
       Can you believe it? After I laboured for hours on every button and every link, positioning and repositioning elements, even trying to apply my newly aquired knowledge of JQuery to it - he likes the colors! I was really upset with the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, after al, I think the problem was not the answer. It was the question. I was not specific about what I was asking. Have I said, "What do you think of layout/buttons/ the way elements are animated " and so, - my husband would know what to take into consideration  and would probably give me more specific feedback. And that's only one example

       Imporatant as it is to ask questions in general , it is no less important to ask them correctly - so the person being asked knows where to look for the answer. And it can be really difficult sometimes - with all the tech terms and all.

       I remember Posting question on our Google+ community about problem with my microphone - it was muted during hangouts sessions for some reason. I loved how specific people's answers were. They gave me step-by-step instructions to the issue, and tha really helped!

      No doubt, asking technical questions, we have to be very specific - expaining every step that was made, and all the circumstances at the moment when the problem appeared. This way other people might remember going through same routine, or they simply can see which step was done wrong and caused the problem.
