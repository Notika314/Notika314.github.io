    <p>When we determine how much space our elements will take on a page, and how far from other elements it will stand,we will need to set such element's properties as margin, border and padding. Let's figure out what each of this properties does. </p>
    <p>Padding is the distance between the content of an element (like text) and its border. By extending the padding we push the border away from element. We set padding like this:  "padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px" , where we start from the top padding ( how far the border will go from element and up) , and go clockwise. Or we can set it like this: "padding: 10px"; in this case padding is set to 10px for each side of an element.</p>
    <p>Margin determines how far the element will stay from other closest elements on the page. We set margin same way as we set padding. Margin is transparent , which means that background-color of an element does not apply to it.</p>
    <p>We use border property when we want to to see not only the content, but as well some kind of a "frame" around it. We can set border to be different color, thickness, we can set border-radius, make it solid or dashed - there are lot's of options.
