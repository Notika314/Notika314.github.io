  <h1>Stereothype Threat</h1>
  <h2>January 10, 2015</h2>

      I can't say I was not aware that such thing as Stereotype Threat exist in general, but I definitely read about it or even found out there is a name for it first time today.

      Coming to US, I did not know much of how very diverse this country is - I mean I did not know how REALLY diverse it is. And even less I knew that every minority/majority froup here is expected to take certain socioeconomical and professional places on the map of American society. But by now I did experience that some people might have certain expectation from, lets say , girl from Eastern Europe. It defnitely mad me feel bad for a moment, but did not change my self-esteem. Of course, it could be different if I grew up seing these stereotypes been applied to me, but by age 21 I knew already who I was and was not.

        Researching the topic, I was surprised to find out , that even students with great SAT scores would drop out of college more often, if they were from,let's say, African American or Hispanic community. Maybe in colleges stereotypes have more influence on student then in high school, and students are more vulnerable to them? Or maybe because when in college, students often do not live with their families, so they do not have as much support as before? I don't know. But I can say, I definetely see that the beliefs that people from certain backgrounds are tied to certain life scenarios are very strong.

      How to deal wit it? I think, first of all, there should be support from family and community. Every person should believe that no one determines his/her life, but himself/herself. If parents and teachers make sure that child knows how good he or she is in certain subject(there always will be such subject, is it math or dancing, or writing poems), that child will have enough confidence to stand up against  stereotypes. And I do  believe that people who are not strong enough to live against these stereotypes, are people who do not have or did not have enough support and faith in their abilities from family. Even more, person's family expects person to fail. And these expectation are the hardest to fight against.
