  <h1>Thinking style and learning.</h1>
  <h2>December 5, 2014</h2>



  <section class="blogbody">
    <p>
      As I took the test to determine my thinking style,it showed that I'm in-between Concrete Random and Abstract Sequential styles( kind of weird combination to me.)
    </p>
    <p>
      So, on one side, I like analyzing situations before finding solutions to the problems( true),on the other hand, there are situations( usually when I don't have enough materials to learn from or when I'm stuck with a problem,) I do like to experiment and take risks.
    </p>
    <p>
      I supppose it is a good thing that i don't limit myself to one way of solving problem,but I might sometimes try to understand material better before diving into my "experimental mode" and trying everything out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another thing i want to work on,is to be able to go back to already completed problem in order to redo or improve it( I really hate to do that).
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, I know I tend to panick if something seems to difficult. That's what I am working on now. I found that if I read the problem , than leave it for a while , letting my brain to process it while I  do something else ( work out, sleep, or go out), then come back to it later, my understanding of a topic usually goes further, and I can start work on it. As well I break it into smaller parts, so i don't feel intimidated by how much there is to accomplish.
    </p>
    <p>
      But other than that, I am pretty happy with how my brain processes new information. As long as I understand something, I am able to connect it to other subjects, like puzzle piece, to get "big picture", and that helps me to remember it better.
    </p>
    <p>
      And of course, we should not limit ourselves to what tests say, or to how we are able to process material now. To improve my way of learning , I've been trying new tricks lately, like "Pomodoro", creating to-do lists; and I want try some other.
