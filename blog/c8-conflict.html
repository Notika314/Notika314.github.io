      Talking about conflict...
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember once I was in a mall, and found a great coat to buy. the only thing - it would cost me way cheaper with store's credit card, but I did not have one. My husband has card of that store, so I asked person at checkout whether I can call my husband, get card's number and pay that way.She said that i could do that. After calling and getting the number I came back to checkout, and there was different girl there, who said they are not allowed to process it that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt upset for two reasons.First, I specifically asked whether I could do it,got positive answer,just to find out later that it's not going to work.Secondly, the girl was saying to her co-worker, just in fron of me "This way anybody can use anybody's card, even stolen one".I thought, although she might be right about what she said, it was disrespectful of her to say  such thing in front of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      That's why I called a manager and asked her to help me with the issue as well as let her know about how the girl was talking to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, I don't think I would do anything differently If I could go back, except maybe not being so emotional over that. That's one thing I might need to work on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, as I look at some other conflicts in my life, in a lot of cases the reason of the conflicts is that I don't articulate my thoughts when I have to. I just expect people to understand what I want and then get upset that they do not act as I expect them to. So I could prevent lots of conflicts if I let people know about my expectations, so we could discuss them and get to mutual agreement.
