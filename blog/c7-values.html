  <h1>Values</h1>
  <h2>January 17, 2015</h2>



  <section class="blogbody">
    <p>
      When I thinkof the happiest times in my life, in most cases the values that come to my mind are: adventure, creativity, freedom , friendship, achievement. So these are the values that make me happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I think about whether do I live up to these values on the scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is "Disagree" and 5- "Agree", it will look like:
    </p>
    <p>
      adventure: 2
    </p>
    <p>
      creativity: 3
    </p>
    <p>
      freedom : 3
    </p>
    <p>
      friendship : 3
    </p>
    <p>
     achievement: 4
    </p>
    <p>
      while these values are so important to me, I must say that lately I don't live up to them as much as I could
    </p>
    <p>
      among these values, adventure and freedom would probably take the top place - not because I posess them more than others, but because I feel my happiest when I live up to them. Some of the happiest times in my life were where I did not know exactly where I am going to be next day, and what the next day will be like. Not that I don't like stability at all, but travelling, especially travelling without a plan makes me high in a way. Of course, that includes friendship too.

    <p>
      The topic that I am most often asked for advice at, is probably relationship, which is probably common, and I am not sure whether that's because I am good at that topic or because that's what girlfriens do anyway. Another thing would probably be sports, fitness and stuff, because some of my friends think that I am I know a lot about it, being swimmer and all. And I have to say it does make me feel good to be asked for advice in activity that I like.

    <p>
      It is hard to say whether my values will help me to deal with stereotype threat , but I would definitely try to remind myself of them if I feel low or insecure for some reason at DBC.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as for exersises to help me feel better , sports always work , as well as simply talking to my freinds and family.
