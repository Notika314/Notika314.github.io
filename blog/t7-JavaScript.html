  <h2 class="heading">Post 7. Looping in Ruby vs. Looping in JavaScript.</h2>

    <p>
      While programming in Ruby, I got used to so many different ways available for looping. I mean, I could loop conditionally, unconditionally, fixed number of times, loop through an array or a range of numbers.I could even loop without realizing that I was - with methods like #map, #each and many others.
    </p>
    <p>
       That's one of the reasons why trnsition to Javascript from Ruby was so painful, In Javascript, I have just 3 ways to loop :
    </p>
    <p>
      -'while' loop, works same way as the one in Ruby, with some syntax differences.Looping happens while conditional statement we give to 'while' evaluates to 'true';
    </p>
    <p>
      -'do' loop -uncoditional loop, it runs forever, unless you provide a 'break' keyword to get out of it;
    </p>
    <p>
      -'for' loop - loop with a counter. We initiate the variable to some value, provide a boundary , and a statement that increases initial variable. 'For' loop runs on and on until counter reaches the boundary.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is also a variation of a 'while' loop: the loop starts with the keyword "do", then goes the body of the loop, and then we close the loop with the keyword 'while' with statement provided to it:
      <pre>
        <code>
         do {
            var name = prompt("Who are you?");
          } while (!name);
          console.log(name);
        </code>
      </pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      In "do .. while" loop the expression inside the loop's body will be evaluated at least once , before checking the condition with "while".
    </p>
    <p>
      Another way to loop with "for" , is "for/in" . In this case, we loop through the properties of an object:
      <pre>
        <code>
          var person = {fname: "Silvia", lname: "Rustagi", age: 32}
          var x;
          for (x in person) {
          console.log(person[x])
        };
       </code>
     </pre>
   </p>
   <p>
    There is no "until" loop in Ruby, but it can be replaced with 'while' and negated statement, like:
    <pre>
      <code>
        while (!(cindition)) {
      };
      </code>
    </pre>
  </p>
  <p>
     I am a big fun of "until" loop - it speaks for itself, easy to follow, but other than that "while (negated statement)" does the work just fine.
   </p>
   <p>
    There is another trick in Javascript, that is simular to "break": "continue" keyword. It breaks one iteration if condition given to it evaluate to 'true', and jumps to the next round of looping:
    <pre>
      <code>
        for (i=0; i<=10; i++) {
        if (i === 3) continue;
        console.log("the number is " + i + " ");
      };
     </code>
   </pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    To sum up, Javascript has smaller toolbox for looping compared to Ruby. The biggest difference is an absence of methods like #each , #map, #select and others(in Ruby they are provided with Enumerable module), that iterate through elements in array/range , modifying or somehow else using them. In JS, we have to use "for/in" loop for such purposes, and explicitly write the code inside the loop that will do the task.
    </p.
    <p>
      I like to compare how less methods and ways to do stuff are available in JS compared to Ruby to having to cook from scratch instead of using pre-made mixes and pre-cut vegies in our kitchen. The pre-made stuff makes our lives easier, and allow us to concentrate on some more complicated part of task.
